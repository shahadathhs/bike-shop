### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shahadathhs/bike-shop.git
   cd bike-shop
   ```

2. **Setup Backend:**

   - Navigate to the server directory:

     ```bash
     cd server
     ```

   - Install dependencies:

     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

   - Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory using the provided `.env.example` as a template:

   - Start the backend server:

     ```bash
     npm run start:dev
     ```

3. **Setup Frontend:**

   - Navigate to the client directory:

     ```bash
     cd client
     ```

   - Install dependencies:

     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

   - Create a `.env` file in the `client` directory using the provided `.env.example` as a template:

   - Start the frontend development server:

     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```

## Running Locally

- **Backend:** Ensure MongoDB is running and the `.env` file is configured correctly. Run the backend server with `npm run start:dev`.
- **Frontend:** Run the frontend with `npm run dev` and open the URL provided in your terminal (usually `http://localhost:3000`).

## Instructions & Guidelines

1. **Follow the .env.example Files:**  
   - Make sure to configure your environment variables correctly. Do not commit your actual secrets.

2. **Development Workflow:**  
   - Use separate branches for new features.
   - Write clear commit messages and maintain a clean codebase.
   - Document any changes in your README or relevant documentation files.

3. **Testing:**  
   - Ensure you test critical flows such as user authentication, product management, and checkout processes.

4. **Deployment:**  
   - The project is deployed on Vercel. Use Vercelâ€™s CLI or dashboard to manage deployments.

## Additional Notes

- **Error Handling:**  
  Custom error classes and middleware are used in the backend for consistent error responses.
